    <h1>Agentic AI: What It Is and Why It Matters</h1>

    <p>
      Agentic AI is a new generation of AI systems that go beyond simply answering questions. 
      Instead of giving text responses only, agentic models can <strong>understand intent, take actions, 
      plan steps, and interact with external tools or systems</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Agentic AI?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional chat models, agentic AI can:
      <br>• analyze the user’s goal  
      <br>• decide what steps are needed  
      <br>• call tools, APIs, or workflows  
      <br>• gather missing information  
      <br>• adjust its plan if something changes  
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, it's not just a model that “responds”—it's a model that can 
      <strong>act</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>How Is It Different From Regular ChatGPT?</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional chat models (like early ChatGPT versions) respond based on text only.  
      They don’t know how to:
      <br>• call APIs  
      <br>• execute tasks  
      <br>• follow multi-step flows  
      <br>• maintain long-term context  
    </p>

    <p>
      Agentic AI, however, can connect to tools like <strong>n8n, Zapier, custom APIs, databases, or internal government systems</strong>.  
      It thinks in steps and can take actions, not just answer questions.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Is Agentic AI Used?</h2>
    <p>
      Agentic AI is useful in any real-world workflow that requires:
      <br>• multiple steps  
      <br>• missing information  
      <br>• decisions  
      <br>• tool execution  
    </p>

    <p>Popular examples include:</p>

    <p>
      • <strong>Government services</strong>: renewing IDs, checking applications, filling forms  
      <br>• <strong>Customer support automation</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>Financial services workflows</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>Healthcare onboarding & forms</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>Internal company operations</strong> (HR, IT, approvals)  
    </p>

    <p>
      These systems benefit because agentic AI can guide users, detect missing data, and execute actions behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Agentic AI brings automation closer to how humans think.  
      It can reduce friction, remove manual steps, and make complex systems feel simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      As workflows, organizations, and digital services grow more complex, 
      agentic AI becomes a powerful way to scale processes without increasing effort or cost.
